Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

What is Requirement Analysis?

About the Project
The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.

Learning Objective
The objective of this project is to enhance a professional developer’s ability to:

Master the principles and methodologies of Requirement Analysis in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
Efficiently translate project needs into structured documentation.
Identify and categorize functional and non-functional requirements for scalable systems.
Leverage tools like Draw.io for visual representation of system requirements.
Establish clear acceptance criteria to ensure alignment with business and user goals.
Apply best practices to produce industry-standard documentation and diagrams.
Requirements
To complete the tasks, learners must:

Have access to a GitHub account and basic knowledge of creating repositories.
Be familiar with writing clear, structured markdown files in README.md.
Understand the SDLC process and the role of requirement analysis in it.
Have experience with tools like Draw.io or equivalent for creating diagrams.
Be able to conceptualize and articulate project requirements, use cases, and acceptance criteria.
Access the case study for reference to the booking management system.
Key Highlights

Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Real-world Application: The project emulates real-life software requirement analysis tasks to give learners hands-on experience with documentation and project planning.
Comprehensive Documentation: Develop detailed explanations of key concepts like requirement gathering, functional vs. non-functional requirements, and use case diagrams.
Visual Representations: Use diagrams to illustrate system actors and interactions for a clear and concise depiction of requirements.
Practical Insights: Learn how to define acceptance criteria and their role in ensuring project success.
Structured Learning Path: Each task builds on the previous one, reinforcing knowledge and application step-by-step.
Professional Standards: Emphasis on industry-standard practices ensures readiness for advanced-level projects and client engagements.
This project aims to sharpen skills essential for managing and delivering robust software systems by focusing on the cornerstone of successful development: Requirement Analysis.

Acceptance Criteria.

The Customer/Manager app sends the request to the load balancer and it distributes the request to booking management servers. Then the service request for data through Redis and Cassandra. through Redis, it requests recent data as it is a caching server. Which could reduce the loading time on the app side.
As you can see in the above design there is a Kafka consumer for notification, notification consumers send the notification. That could be to the customer/manager, like whenever a customer books a hotel notification is sent to the manager or if a new offers come it’s notified to the customer.
